	abstract = {Quantum defect theory (QDT) is concerned with the properties of an electron in the field of a positive ion and, in particular, with expressing those properties in terms of analytical functions of the energy. It provides a unified theory of bound states, including series perturbations, autoionisation and electron-ion scattering, both elastic and inelastic. The main emphasis of the review is on the foundations of the theory. Properties of Coulomb functions are discussed in some detail and outline sketches are given of relevant topics in collision theory and radiative theory. One-channel and many- channel QDT are discussed separately. Applications to the following problems are considered: resonances, atomic collision calculations, systems with two energy levels of the ion core, helium, other rare gases, alkaline earths and other atomic systems, molecular hydrogen, dielectronic recombination},

The content is evenly balanced between the physical foundations of spectroscopy and their applications to astronomical objects and cosmology. An undergraduate knowledge of physics is assumed, and relevant basic material is summarised at the beginning of each chapter. The material is completely self-contained and features sufficient background information for self-study. Advanced users will find it handy for spectroscopic studies. A website hosted by the authors contains updates, corrections, exercises and solutions, as well as news items from physics and astronomy related to spectroscopy.
