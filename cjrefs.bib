It provides a unified theory of bound states, including series perturbations, autoionisation and electron-ion scattering, both elastic and inelastic. The main emphasis of the review is on the foundations of the theory. Properties of Coulomb functions are discussed in some detail and outline sketches are given of relevant topics in collision theory and radiative theory. One-channel and many- channel QDT are discussed separately. Applications to the following problems are considered: resonances, atomic collision calculations, systems with two energy levels of the ion core, helium, other rare gases, alkaline earths and other atomic systems, molecular hydrogen, dielectronic recombination},

The content is evenly balanced between the physical foundations of spectroscopy and their applications to astronomical objects and cosmology. An undergraduate knowledge of physics is assumed, and relevant basic material is summarised at the beginning of each chapter. The material is completely self-contained and features sufficient background information for self-study. Advanced users will find it handy for spectroscopic studies.

  abstract  = {The present article is less comprehensive than the title would suggest. Firstly, the treatment is confined to spectra arising through the excitation of the outermost electrons in free atoms or ions, thus excluding, for instance, X-ray spectra, which are the subject of other articles in this Encyclopedia1. Also the influence on atomic spectra of external magnetic and electric fields---that is, the Zeeman and the Stark effects, is treated elsewhere2 and therefore not included here. The same applies to hyperfine structure and isotope shifts3. Finally, since the theory of atomic spectra is covered in the articles4 by Hund and by Bethe and Salpeter, no attempt has been made to give a consistent picture of the theory, although the results of theoretical derivations are frequently quoted and used. In brief, the present article is concerned with the undisturbed gross structure of the energy-level systems of free atoms and ions, the main content being a description---in terms of the theory and with quantitative examples from observed spectra---of regularities in various types of atomic systems and of relationships between different, especially isoelectronic, systems. The article is intended to give a survey of empirical data in a form useful to the theorist and at the same time to provide the experimentalist with a collection of theoretical results for direct application and with efficient methods for the analysis and description of his observations. A considerable part of the material, in particular of the chapter on isoelectronic sequences, has not been previously published.},

Hartree-Fock-Slater wavefunctions served as zeroth-order eigenfunctions to compute the expectation of the total Hamiltonian. A first-order approximation to the local approximation was thus included. Quantum-electrodynamic corrections were made. Each transition energy was computed as the difference between results of separate self-consistent-field calculations for the initial, singly ionized state and the final two-hole state. The following quantities are listed: total transition energy, “electric” (Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater) contribution, magnetic and retardation contributions, and contributions due to vacuum polarization and self energy.},
